本来这是一个团队项目，我是负责其中美术方面的内容包括ui设计，图标设计等。这是一个二手游戏账号交易平台的大致构想，
我认为他的界面应该尽可能干净利落，需要必要的功能引导效果，并作为辅佐极力追求凸显售卖的商品本身的内容。
然后主题色在各个页面都要是统一的。以此为中心思想诞生的ui设计，想尽量往简约大气但又不乏活力的方向做。
Originally, this was a team project, and I was responsible for the art aspects including UI design, icon design, and more. This is the general concept of a second-hand game account trading platform,
and I believe its interface should be as clean as possible, requiring necessary functional guidance effects, and as an assistant, striving to highlight the content of the sold products themselves.
Then the theme color should be consistent across all pages. The UI design, which was born with this as the central idea, aims to strive for a minimalist yet dynamic direction.
